# Soccer-Player-Performance-Analysis 

This project analyzes the performance of outfield players from the English Premier League 2023 season, focusing on metrics influencing goal-scoring and predicting Player of the Match (POTM). Using Python, along with a dataset of 421 players and 28 variables, we conducted data cleaning, EDA, and implemented machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) to uncover actionable insights. Key findings highlight the importance of Goals and Assists in determining player impact, with models achieving up to 84.5% accuracy. Future work explores ensemble methods and feature enhancements for improved predictions.
